title: Initializing Git Pusshuten for your application
---

To initialize Git Pusshuten with your application, move to the root of your application and run the following command.

<% code do %>
gitpusshuten initialize
<% end %>

What this will do is initialize Git, if not yet initialized. It will add a line to the .gitignore file. And it will create a _hidden_ directory in the root of your application ( approot/__.gitpusshuten__ ). There will be two files generated inside of this directory, namely: **config.rb** and **hooks.rb**. These are the two files you most likely want to check into your git repository. These are the only files that are generated by the __core__ of Git Pusshuten (aside of the logs, which are "git ignored" by default). Modules may add additional directories and files. For example, when you use the **NginX** or **Apache** module, it'll create an **.gitpusshuten/nginx** or **.gitpusshuten/apache** directory to store their specific files in.
