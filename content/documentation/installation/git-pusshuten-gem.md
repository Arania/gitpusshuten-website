title: Installing Git Pusshuten
---

Installing Git Pusshuten is very simple. All you need is Ruby and RubyGems since Git Pusshuten is a Gem.

I highly recommend using [RVM (Ruby Version Manager)](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) for installing and managing Ruby versions.

Once you have Ruby up and running, simply install the gem and you're ready to go.

<% code do %>
gem install gitpusshuten
<% end %>
