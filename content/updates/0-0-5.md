This release fixes a couple of bugs. The Active Record module has been completely rewritten in a way that enables you to store your application's database.yml on the remote server without having to check it into your git repository (which is a bad practice). Refer to the [Active Record module documentation](/documentation/modules/active-record/) for more information.

This version also introduces "long descriptions", meaning any commands and modules may now consist of more detailed information when utilizing the `help` CLI command on that particular command.

When writing modules, you will now be able to access the `configuration` object from within the deploy hook, giving you more control over your deployment hooks.

When writing modules, the first argument ( command ) will always be underscored when needed to be able to perform certain actions. This has been extended in the `GitPusshuTen::Commands::Base` class.

Fixed a crucial issue where the deployment hooks would be performed in the wrong order in Ruby 1.8.7 and older versions.

When nothing should be logged, it would log a "nil" in Ruby 1.8.7 and earlier versions. This has been fixed.

Fixed the "FileUtils" library to no longer throw warnings regarding already defined constants.
