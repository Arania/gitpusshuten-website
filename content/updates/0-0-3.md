Fixed an issue where the `.gitpusshuten/**/*` git ignore line would not be properly placed on the new line inside the .gitignore file.

When adding a new user to the remote server, Git Pusshuten will ensure certain packages are are installed to provide a smoother application deployment. Common packages these days include libxml, imagemagick, and others.

Moved the `VERSION` constant into a separate file so this can be re-used in multiple locations, such as the gemspec. This reduces some redundancy.

Added aliases for long-named command actions.

Code-base cleanups.
